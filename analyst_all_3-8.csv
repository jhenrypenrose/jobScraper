We’re a small, scrappy data science team that is trying to change the culture at LexisNexis to be more data driven. We’ve already proved the value of data and AB testing, now we need to go to the next level – getting teams to make data central to their decision-making process.

He took the role at LexisNexis for the opportunity to change the culture of a company as big as LN, as well as “expanding the rule of law” (LexisNexis’ mission). So far, he’s been fairly successful, creating an AB testing platform and getting teams throughout LN to engage in AB testing. However, there’s still a lot of ground left to cover. He’s looking for growth-minded data professionals that can grow in their careers as they grow the impact of data for teams throughout LexisNexis.
